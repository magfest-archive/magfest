        <li>The list is pre-populated based on data from previous events, add and delete as necessary.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The numbers contained in this spreadsheet include the amount of MPoints requested from the last event, by denomination, for each department.  The last column in each department also represents the total amounts returned on Sunday.</li>
    <li>All departments start with a “General” request.  If you want to enter separate MPoint requests for different divisions in your department, then copy and paste the General section to the columns next to it, change the title, and enter each division separately.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>For example, see the Arcade or Gameroom sections.</li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>Each section includes the requests, per day and denomination, from the last event. For {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, determine the quantity of denominations you need for each day based on this year's expected activity & what’s in the “{{ c.EVENT_YEAR }} Used” column, and modify the numbers you want.  The “Total Requested” for the event should calculate.  You can ignore the “Used” formula.</li>
    <li>Delete the numbers in the “Returned” column.</li>
    <li>When you are done, please highlight all the rows in your section in dark green.</li>
